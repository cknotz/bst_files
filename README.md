# bst_files

This folder includes some BiBTeX style (.bst) files to format bibliographies in line with journal submission requirements.

All files were created using the makebst routine.

IMPORTANT: The files approximate the journal styles as closely as possible, but some tweaking may still be required!

These files are provided free of charge. I do not accept any liability for damages incurred through using any of these files.
